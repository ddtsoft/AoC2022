# AoC2022

My solutions for the event Advent of code 2022 (AoC2022). I selected to use C++ to solve the pussels and create every day as a include function.
Not all pussels are solved, and those that are can maybe be solved with some other logic but I did this as a personal challange to learn coding and expand my
knowllage in C++.

I did use M$ Visual Studio and the extension for C++.
